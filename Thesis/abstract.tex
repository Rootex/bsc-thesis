This work represents a detailed study of modular development approach, android platform and the technologies accompanied by them. The motivation for this work is derived from the problem faced with developing complex systems and my love for developing android applications. Modular development is a software development approach that emphasizes on dividing a software system into logically functional units (named modules) that can be assembled into a larger system. The software system developed to show the practical application of this approach is a surveillance system, which can run on android devices with the support for camera's. Users can monitor a particular environment with the software system and whenever a face is detected, the user gets notified via both email and sms. This thesis contains both the modeling and implementation of the system adhering to the modular development approach.
